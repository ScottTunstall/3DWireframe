# 3DWireframe
3D Wireframe using C#.   Based on a VB project by leonelmachava (http://codentronix.com)

I had been looking for some time to find simple, easy to read code that demonstrates basic 3D maths, and I found it - in VB.NET.
I translated the code for those that prefer C#.

Don't expect updates.
